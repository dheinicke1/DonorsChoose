The code for the various models are in the ["Previous Versions"]() folder, the code used for my final submission is
["DonorsChoose.py"]()

## Objective

[Donors Choose](https://www.donorschoose.org/about) is a nonprofit organization that pairs teachers throughout the United States who have classroom projects with donors wiling to fund those projects.

The teachers submit an application to Donors Choose that includes a description, application essays, a list of supplies requested, teacher attributes and school attributes. The purpose of the competition is to use these text, categorical and numeric features to predict whether a project will be funded. The prediction is used to assist volunteers for Donors Choose with their project vetting process and allowing volunteers to assist teachers with their applications to increase their chances of a successfully funded project.

Competition submissions are a list of probabilities of the application being approved, rather than a binary prediction (approved or not approved). Submissions are scored on the area under the AUC curve.

The winner achieved a score of 0.828, my model achieved a score of 0.779.
